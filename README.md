This is a project that is both for improving my undearstadning of code and how to use GitHub.
There is also a CompareTo which compares valuse for the sort method, which means diffretn types can be soreted by the same method.
the Dynamic array will have features suck as:
- sort
- remove
    - remove will have to one where you can chose a eliment of the array or an index of the array
- removeAll
- add
- increasSize
- get
- size
- FullSize
    - This will show the empty index of the array as well as the full onces where size will only show the full onces   
- indexOf
     - this will find an eliment in the array and tell you the index of it
-isEmpty
  - returns true or false
- addAll
   - this will add a array of elemtns to your array
- set
    - this sets a value at a perticuler index and replaces the curent valsue
 - ensureCapacity
    - makes sure the array is of a size  specified by the user.
  
The Junit testing is also being add as i wonted to make sure my array worked as inteded, i am also finding this usful for practesing the use of it.
